# Notes 
## First glance
- Several open ports
- Not sure what exploit would be the best or if any even exist that work well
- Looks like webpage
- Ssl is expired, consistent issue 

```
- > enumerate live services -> determine attack path 
```
>[!NOTE] the CVE code mentioned can do the following: 
>issabel-pbx version 4.0.0-6 contains a Broken Access Control vulnerability that manifests as unauthenticated Directory Listing on the web interface. Any remote, unauthenticated attacker >can browse the application's modules directory and directly access sensitive source files, configuration files, and internal application logic without any credentials or authorization.

>[!NOTE] searching metapsloit, we are given the exploit
> 37637.pl, which offers lfi and rce 

>[!NOTE]
>Exploitation
>Note - It might be possible that the webpage cannot be loaded due to Firefox and other browsers
>changing their min TLS version to a number higher than what the box supports. The workaround
>to this is to edit the “security.tls.version.min” to 1.
>To modify the minimum TLS version in Firefox, follow these steps:
>1. Open a new tab in Firefox.Enter "about:config" in the address bar and hit Enter/Return.
>2. In the search box located above the list, enter "security.tls.version.min".
>3. Locate the preference with the name "security.tls.version.min" and modify its value to ‘1’.

If type set to 'database', the primary # AMP admin credentials will be the AMPDBUSER/AMPDBPASS above. AUTHTYPE=database # AMPADMINLOGO=filename # Defines the logo that is to be displayed at the TOP RIGHT of the admin screen. This enables # you to customize the look of the administration screen. # NOTE: images need to be saved in the ..../admin/images directory of your AMP install # This image should be 55px in height AMPADMINLOGO=logo.png # USECATEGORIES=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # Controls if the menu items in the admin interface are sorted by category (true), or sorted # alphabetically with no categories shown (false). # AMPEXTENSIONS=extensions|deviceanduser # Sets the extension behavior in FreePBX. If set to 'extensions', Devices and Users are # administered together as a unified Extension, and appear on a single page. # If set to 'deviceanduser', Devices and Users will be administered seperately. Devices (e.g. # each individual line on a SIP phone) and Users (e.g. '101') will be configured # independent of each other, allowing association of one User to many Devices, or allowing # Users to login and logout of Devices. AMPEXTENSIONS=extensions # ENABLECW=true|false ENABLECW=no # DEFAULT VALUE: true # Enable call waiting by default when an extension is created. Set to 'no' to if you don't want # phones to be commissioned with call waiting already enabled. The user would then be required # to dial the CW feature code (*70 default) to enable their phone. Most installations should leave # this alone. It allows multi-line phones to receive multiple calls on their line appearances. # CWINUSEBUSY=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # For extensions that have CW enabled, report unanswered CW calls as 'busy' (resulting in busy # voicemail greeting). If set to no, unanswered CW calls simply report as 'no-answer'. # AMPBADNUMBER=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # Generate the bad-number context which traps any bogus number or feature code and plays a # message to the effect. If you use the Early Dial feature on some Grandstream phones, you # will want to set this to false. # AMPBACKUPSUDO=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # This option allows you to use sudo when backing up files. Useful ONLY when using AMPPROVROOT # Allows backup and restore of files specified in AMPPROVROOT, based on permissions in /etc/sudoers # for example, adding the following to sudoers would allow the user asterisk to run tar on ANY file # on the system: # asterisk localhost=(root)NOPASSWD: /bin/tar # Defaults:asterisk !requiretty # PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE SECURITY RISKS INVOLVED IN ALLOWING THE ASTERISK USER TO TAR/UNTAR ANY FILE # CUSTOMASERROR=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # If false, then the Destination Registry will not report unknown destinations as errors. This should be # left to the default true and custom destinations should be moved into the new custom apps registry. # DYNAMICHINTS=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # If true, Core will not statically generate hints, but instead make a call to the AMPBIN php script, # and generate_hints.php through an Asterisk's #exec call. This requires Asterisk.conf to be configured # with "execincludes=yes" set in the [options] section. # XTNCONFLICTABORT=true|false # BADDESTABORT=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # Setting either of these to true will result in retrieve_conf aborting during a reload if an extension # conflict is detected or a destination is detected. It is usually better to allow the reload to go # through and then correct the problem but these can be set if a more strict behavior is desired. # SERVERINTITLE=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # Precede browser title with the server name. # USEDEVSTATE = true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # If this is set, it assumes that you are running Asterisk 1.4 or higher and want to take advantage of the # func_devstate.c backport available from Asterisk 1.6. This allows custom hints to be created to support # BLF for server side feature codes such as daynight, followme, etc. # MODULEADMINWGET=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # Module Admin normally tries to get its online information through direct file open type calls to URLs that # go back to the freepbx.org server. If it fails, typically because of content filters in firewalls that # don't like the way PHP formats the requests, the code will fall back and try a wget to pull the information. # This will often solve the problem. However, in such environment there can be a significant timeout before # the failed file open calls to the URLs return and there are often 2-3 of these that occur. Setting this # value will force FreePBX to avoid the attempt to open the URL and go straight to the wget calls. # AMPDISABLELOG=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # Whether or not to invoke the FreePBX log facility # AMPSYSLOGLEVEL=LOG_EMERG|LOG_ALERT|LOG_CRIT|LOG_ERR|LOG_WARNING|LOG_NOTICE|LOG_INFO|LOG_DEBUG|LOG_SQL|SQL # DEFAULT VALUE: LOG_ERR # Where to log if enabled, SQL, LOG_SQL logs to old MySQL table, others are passed to syslog system to # determine where to log # AMPENABLEDEVELDEBUG=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # Whether or not to include log messages marked as 'devel-debug' in the log system # AMPMPG123=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # When set to false, the old MoH behavior is adopted where MP3 files can be loaded and WAV files converted # to MP3. The new default behavior assumes you have mpg123 loaded as well as sox and will convert MP3 files # to WAV. This is highly recommended as MP3 files heavily tax the system and can cause instability on a busy # phone system. # CDR DB Settings: Only used if you don't use the default values provided by FreePBX. # CDRDBHOST: hostname of db server if not the same as AMPDBHOST # CDRDBPORT: Port number for db host # CDRDBUSER: username to connect to db with if it's not the same as AMPDBUSER # CDRDBPASS: password for connecting to db if it's not the same as AMPDBPASS # CDRDBNAME: name of database used for cdr records # CDRDBTYPE: mysql or postgres mysql is default # CDRDBTABLENAME: Name of the table in the db where the cdr is stored cdr is default # AMPVMUMASK=mask # DEFAULT VALUE: 077 # Defaults to 077 allowing only the asterisk user to have any permission on VM files. If set to something # like 007, it would allow the group to have permissions. This can be used if setting apache to a different # user then asterisk, so that the apache user (and thus ARI) can have access to read/write/delete the # voicemail files. If changed, some of the voicemail directory structures may have to be manually changed. # DASHBOARD_STATS_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds # DEFAULT VALUE: 6 # DASHBOARD_INFO_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds # DEFAULT VALUE: 20 # These can be used to change the refresh rate of the System Status Panel. Most of # the stats are updated based on the STATS interval but a few items are checked # less frequently (such as Asterisk Uptime) based on the INFO value # ZAP2DAHDICOMPAT=true|false ZAP2DAHDICOMPAT=true # DEFAULT VALUE: false # If set to true, FreePBX will check if you have chan_dadhi installed. If so, it will # automatically use all your ZAP configuration settings (devices and trunks) and # silently convert them, under the covers, to DAHDI so no changes are needed. The # GUI will continue to refer to these as ZAP but it will use the proper DAHDI channels. # This will also keep Zap Channel DIDs working. # CHECKREFERER=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # When set to the default value of true, all requests into FreePBX that might possibly add/edit/delete # settings will be validated to assure the request is coming from the server. This will protect the system # from CSRF (cross site request forgery) attacks. It will have the effect of preventing legitimately entering # URLs that could modify settings which can be allowed by changing this field to false. # USEQUEUESTATE=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # Setting this flag will generate the required dialplan to integrate with the following Asterisk patch: # https://issues.asterisk.org/view.php?id=15168 # This feature is planned for a future 1.6 release but given the existence of the patch can be used prior. Once # the release version is known, code will be added to automatically enable this format in versions of Asterisk # that support it. # USEGOOGLEDNSFORENUM=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # Setting this flag will generate the required global variable so that enumlookup.agi will use Google DNS # 8.8.8.8 when performing an ENUM lookup. Not all DNS deals with NAPTR record, but Google does. There is a # drawback to this as Google tracks every lookup. If you are not comfortable with this, do not enable this # setting. Please read Google FAQ about this: http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/faq.html#privacy # MOHDIR=subdirectory_name # This is the subdirectory for the MoH files/directories which is located in ASTVARLIBDIR # if not specified it will default to mohmp3 for backward compatibility. MOHDIR=mohmp3 # RELOADCONFIRM=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: true # When set to false, will bypass the confirm on Reload Box # FCBEEPONLY=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # When set to true, a beep is played instead of confirmation message when activating/de-activating: # CallForward, CallWaiting, DayNight, DoNotDisturb and FindMeFollow # DISABLECUSTOMCONTEXTS=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE: false # Normally FreePBX auto-generates a custom context that may be usable for adding custom dialplan to modify the # normal behavior of FreePBX. It takes a good understanding of how Asterisk processes these includes to use # this and in many of the cases, there is no useful application. All includes will result in a WARNING in the # Asterisk log if there is no context found to include though it results in no errors. If you know that you # want the includes, you can set this to true. If you comment it out FreePBX will revert to legacy behavior # and include the contexts. # AMPMODULEXML lets you change the module repository that you use.
