# Observations 
- Obviously a windows machine
- Several ports open
- Services to check
- ## SMB
   - Can I connect?
   - No, access denied
   - Not smbV1 version
   - nxc smb $ip -u admin -p pass # guest
   - nxc smb 10.129.30.252 -u '' -p ''
   - nxc smb $ip -u admin -p "" --shares # reveals actual shares, thanks to nuclei scan i found out this was possible #spidering shares is possible
   - Turns out guest users can download files when using -u admin and -p '' as their credentials
 ### Credentials 
 ldap_bind_password = sunrise 
 
 pwm_admin_password = password 
 
 tomacat_users = username = "admin" password = T0mc@tAdm1n
 
 pwm_admin_pasword = !vault
 


- LDAP
   - Can I connect?
   - ldapwhoami -x -H ldap://target.com # unsuccessful
   - ldapsearch -x -H ldap://target.com -b "dc=example,dc=com" # unsuccessful 
   - ldapsearch -x -H ldaps://$ip:636 -D "cn=admin,dc=authority,dc=htb" -w password -b "dc=authority,dc=htb" # unsuccessful
   - ldapsearch -x -H ldap://$ip -b "dc=authority,dc=htb"  #unsucessful 
   - ldapsearch -x -H ldap://$ip -b "" -s base "(objectclass=*)" # worked
 
- Port 80
  - Reveals exposed internet information services information
 
- RPCClient
   - Connection is possible, but without authnetication, use is extremely limited 
  ```
   - rpcclient -U "" -N $ip
   ```
- Port 8443
  - Reveals a private login for username and password
```
 
PWM is currently in configuration mode. This mode allows updating the configuration without authenticating to an LDAP directory first. End user functionality is not available in this mode.

After you have verified the LDAP directory settings, use the Configuration Manager to restrict the configuration to prevent unauthorized changes. After restricting, the configuration can still be changed but will require LDAP directory authentication first.
```
Clicking on configuration mode reveals that a user has authentticated successfully form the address 10.129.204.183. 
- Host seems down, If it is up, but blocking probes, try -Pn
- Identity was svc_pwm DC=htb,DC=corp
- had been trying to authenticate to ldap search by using the wrong thang
- Looks like authentication through no identity has been done with address 127.0.0.1
>[!NOTE]
>Saw this
>The PWM (Password Management for LDAP) does not have a default password; it requires you to set a configuration password during the initial setup. You must create a strong password for configuration access when you first configure PWM.

Credential Combinations That Were Tried 
```
root:!vault 
root:password
admin:password 
admin:!vault
```
Configuration Password Values Tried 
password 
!vault 
sunrise

- Need to log into pwm but don't know how
- Have had several authentication failures but not sure what to do about it
- Have read access to important information via smb but unsure how to exploit/use since ca't connect to ldap
